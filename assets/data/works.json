For this, we studied the [liboqs](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs) project for hybrid key encryption of openSSH, and BB84 protocol. There is also an implementation of Quantum Medical Image Encryption (available [here](https://github.com/harshitgarg22/quantum_image_encryption)) that I worked on.",
